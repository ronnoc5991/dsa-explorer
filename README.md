# DSA Explorer

What? A place to explore data structures and algorithms.

Why? To solidify my own knowledge and to serve as a resource for my future self and possibly others.

How? A site with pages dedicated to different data structures or algorithms with explanations, history, illustrations and interactive bits.

## Algorithms

### Pathfinding
- BFS
- DFS
- Dijkstra's
- A-star
- D-star?

#### Pathfinding DS
- adjacency list (array of lists of vertices)
- adjacency matrix (matrix containing 1's for edges and 0's for no edges)
