# TODO

- create a graph class (addEdge, removeEdge, getEdges)
- create a graph using that class's methods
- start implementing algos that operate on this graph interface
- start with adjacency list implementation, could also do adjacency matrix implementation
- from this, we get two data structures... and some algos
